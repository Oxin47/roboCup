	<h2>Pointsgame League 2013</h2>

	<div>On april 28 starts a new *yearly* points tournament Pointsgame League 2013 !</div>

	<div>Ideologically, we consider the league as a continuation of RoboCups, so-called "blitz-CHAOS" and manual
		tournaments.
	</div>

	<div>So, what is our PL 2013 ?</div>

	<ol>

		<li>First of all, it's a major tournament consisting of one-day RoboCups.
			<br/>To take a part on any of these RoboCups you
			should just be at
			<a href="http://zagram.org/index.en.html" target="_blank">zagram</a>
			and enter "!register" into the public chat, as always.
		</li>

		<li>Each tournament is <a href="aboutSwiss" target="_blank">Swiss</a>-based.
			Each won game gives you&nbsp;4
			points, each draw gives&nbsp;2, each loss gives&nbsp;1.
			<br/>Tournament results are summed up -- that is exactly the final league result table.
		</li>

		<li>Only the best 15 tournament results are counted into the final sum.
			<br/>Overall number of appointments is 18. This corresponds to about "once in 2 weeks".
		</li>

		<li>
			We ask to take a part in the tournament only if you plan to play at least half of the games.
			<br/>To prevent cheating a pair of (slightly messy) rules are applied:
			<ul>
				<li>"Dummy" players, e.g. those who played less than half of the games, get 0 points in any case.
				</li>
				<li>After the tournament we count the number of non-dummy players,
					and overall number of participants.
					If these tho numbers lie in different "powers of two",
					e.g. if one additional round started because of the "dummy" players,
					players get a 4 point less value into the final league sum.
					<br/>If there was no "power of two" switch, then simple number of gained points is counted in.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			Everyone can take a part in each of the tournaments.
			<br/>But, if one wants his results to be summed up,
			he must always play using the same nickname.
			Also, tournament organizers may ask to confirm that
			he's not a "clone" of some other player.
		</li>

		<li>
			We plan to variate tournament rules a lot.
			We plan to include tournaments based on polish rules.:)
			The same with 4-cross, blitz and not blitz etc.
		</li>

		<li>
			In the spirit of official rules we note,
			as always, that organizers preserve the right
			to change tournament rules if they deem it necessary.
		</li>
	</ol>
