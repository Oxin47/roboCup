		<h2>Rules</h2>
		Individual rules of this tournament: <br /> <br />
		<ul>
			<li>Tournament organization scheme is "King of the hill", which
				is also a variation of the swiss tournament system.</li>
			<li>All players play an equal number of rounds.</li>
			<li>Number of rounds depends on number of participants: <br />
				<table>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>5-8 players</td>
							<td>9-16 players</td>
							<td>17-32 players</td>
							<td>33-64 players</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>5 rounds</td>
							<td>6 rounds</td>
							<td>7 rounds</td>
							<td>8 rounds</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</li>
			<li>The goal of a player is to maximize points taken in the
				tournament. Each win gives 4 points, each draw gives 2 points, each
				loss gives 1 point.</li>
			<li>At start of each round all players are sorted by obtained
				points. The strongest player is matched in a game with the second. The third
				with the fourth. And so on. <br /> Example. Suppose players had
				17, 15, 14, 13, 13, 11 points. Then assigned games will be: <br />
				"17"-"15", <br /> "14"-"some of the 13", <br /> "the other
				13"-"11".</li>
			<li>Time between rounds (time to rest) is set to <span
				class="lift:ConstantsSnippet.tourBrakeTime"></span> minutes.</li>
			<li>Game settings are: 3 minutes for the first turn, 1 minute
				starting time, <span class="lift:ConstantsSnippet.secsPerTurn"></span>
				sec/turn, unrated, 1-cross.</li>
		</ul>
